Used as a more readable equivalent to the traditional for loop operating over a range of values, such as all elements in a container.

### Chain :

Represent combining between 2 containers (include string).

### Zip :

Represent parallel connection between 2 containers.

### Product : 

Represent Cartesian product between 2 containers.

### Powerset :

Represent all the sub-groups of container.

### What is iterable?
